This part of the documentation contains explanations and examples of more
obscure aspects of **Groupy**.

Attachments
===========

Attachments are a common part of :class:`~groupy.object.responses.Message`\ s
and there are several different types. Currently, **Groupy** supports the
following types of attachments:

- :class:`~groupy.object.attachments.Location` - for locations
- :class:`~groupy.object.attachments.Image` - for images
- :class:`~groupy.object.attachments.Mentions` - for "@" mentions
- :class:`~groupy.object.attachments.Emoji` - for emoticons
- :class:`~groupy.object.attachments.Split` - for splitting bills\ [*]_

For all other types of attachments (such as those introduced in the future)
there exists a :class:`~groupy.object.attachments.GenericAttachment`.

.. [*] Split attachments are depreciated.

Types
-----

The section covers the various types of attachments and how to create them.

Locations
^^^^^^^^^

:class:`~groupy.object.attachments.Location` attachments are the simplest of all
attachment types. Each includes a ``name``, a latitude ``lat``, and a longitude
``lng``. Some location attachments also contain a ``foursqure_venue_id``.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from groupy import attachments
    >>> loc = attachments.Location('My house', lat=34, lng=-84)
    >>> loc
    Location('My house', lat=34, lng=-84)
    >>> loc.name
    'My house'
    >>> loc.lat, loc.lng
    (34, -84)

Images
^^^^^^

:class:`~groupy.object.attachments.Image` attachments are unique in that they do
not actually contain the image data. Instead, they specify the URL from which
you can obtain the actual image. To create a new image from a local file object,
use the :func:`~groupy.object.attachments.Image.file` method.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from groupy import attachments
    >>> image_attachment = attachments.Image.file(open(filename, 'rb'))
    >>> image_attachment
    Image(url='http://i.groupme.com/123456789')
    >>> image_attachment.url
    'http://i.groupme.com/123456789'

We can see that the image has been uploaded in exchange for a URL via the
GroupMe image service.

To fetch the actual image from an image attachment, simply use its
:func:`~groupy.object.attachments.Image.download` method. The image is returned
as a :class:`Pillow Image<PIL.Image.Image>`, so saving it to a file is simple.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> image_file = image_attachment.download()
    >>> image_file.save(filename)


Mentions
^^^^^^^^

:class:`~groupy.object.attachments.Mentions` are a new type of attachment and
have yet to be documented. However, they are simple to understand. Mentions
capture the details necessary to highlight "@" mentions of members in groups.
They contain a list of ``loci`` and an equal-sized list of ``user_ids``. Let's
find a good example to demonstrate mentions.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from groupy import Group
    >>> message = None
    >>> mention = None
    >>> for g in Group.list():
    ...   for m in g.messages():
    ...     for a in m.attachments:
    ...       if a.type == 'mentions' and len(a.user_ids) > 1:
    ...         message = m
    ...         mention = a
    ...         break
    >>> message.text
    '@Bill hey I saw you with @Zoe Childs at the park!'
    >>> mention.user_ids
    ['1234567', '5671234']
    >>> mention.loci
    [[0, 5], [25, 11]]
    
As you can see, each element in ``loci`` has two integers, the first of which
indicates the starting index of the mentioning text, while second indicates its
length. The strings in ``user_ids`` correspond *by index* to the elements in
``loci``. You can use the ``loci`` to extract the mentioning portion of the
text, as well as obtain the mentioned member via ``user_ids``.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> for uid, (start, length) in zip(mention.user_ids, mention.loci):
    ...   end = start + length
    ...   uid, message.text[start:end]
    ...   member = message.group.members().filter(user_id=uid).first
    ...   member.uid, member.nickname
    ('1234567', '@Bill')
    ('1234567', 'Bill')
    ('5671234', '@Zoe Childs')
    ('5671234', 'Zoe Childs')


To create a mention, simply pass in a :class:`list` of user IDs and an
equally-sized :class:`list` of loci.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from groupy.attachments import Mentions
    >>> Mentions(['1234567', '2345671'], [[0, 4], [5, 3]])
    Mentions(['1234567', '2345671'])


Emojis
^^^^^^

Emojis are relatively undocumented but frequently appear in messages. More
documentation will come as more is learned.

Emoji attachments have a ``placeholder`` and a ``charmap``. The ``placeholder``
is a high-point or unicode character designed to mark the location of the emoji
in the text of the message. The ``charmap`` serves as some sort of translation
or lookup tool for obtaining the actual emoji.

Splits
^^^^^^

.. note::

    This type of attachment is depreciated. They were part of GroupMe's bill
    splitting feature that seems to no longer be implemented in their clients.
    **Groupy**, however, still supports them due to their presence in older
    messages.

:class:`~groupy.object.attachments.Split` attachments have a single attribute:
``token``.


Sending Attachments
-------------------

To send an attachment along with a message, simply append it to the
:func:`~groupy.object.responses.Recipient.post` method as another argument.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from groupy import Group
    >>> from groupy.attachment import Location
    >>> loc = Location.create('My house', lat=33, lng=-84)
    >>> group = Group.list().first
    >>> group.post("Hey meet me here", loc)

If there are several attachments you'd like to send in a single message, simply
keep appending them!

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from groupy.attachment import Image
    >>> img = Image.file('front-door.png')
    >>> group.post("I said meet me here!", loc, img)

Alternatively, you can collect multiple attachments into an
:class:`iterable<collections.abc.Iterable>`.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> attachments = [img, loc]
    >>> group.post("Are you listening?", *attachments)
